This project is a simple app to show the current date and time in decimal time format and it allows to convert between legacy and new time.

It was developed by react.js, bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/">Create React App</a>. For time and date conversion <a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> is used. It comes with Babel, Webpack, ESlint and other nice features. For further details and commands see the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/">Create React App documentation</a>.
